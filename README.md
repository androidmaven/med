Don’t optimize prematurely

Premature optimization is a serious issue among the coding community. For real-time projects, optimization is necessary. Other projects, such as games, also require optimization to a certain degree for better user experience, certification for publication, etc.

However, that doesn’t mean you should start optimizing your game in its half-baked state. It's a good idea to optimize after a good chunk of functionality has been implemented. The late start will help you to avoid unnecessary work and keep you productive.





When codes get naughty, sleep over it!

Working fewer hours can help you remain productive. In the meantime, you also need to get proper sleep. Without proper sleep you can easily hamper your productivity to a great extent. Not to mention, improper sleep can also hamper your health and cognitive capabilities.



Before you build it, research for all libraries and frameworks you will need upfront.

When looking to increase productivity for developers, it may seem counterintuitive to have them spend more time away from their keyboards. But adequate planning and specification of work are well worth the effort.



Unclear requirements cause confusion, which is the most frustrating roadblock for every developer who needs to code rules and logic into their applications.



By spending some time to properly plan your project and simplifying your planning process, you’ll save time on fixing and redesigning things when developers are actively coding.





Reduce cognitive coding, increase building usable softwares.

Write a function that returns an array containing the currencies  for an ATM transaction, assuming the ATM can dispense all the available Nigerian currencies, 1k to N5 so if you have someone that wants to withdraw 750 the function should return [500, 200, 50] you can't return 100 naira bills since there's a 200 naira currency...
Create a software usable that an ATM machine that handle improve the experience of the withdrawal process.
Brainstorm on building a module adaptable by banks or/and fin-techs.
